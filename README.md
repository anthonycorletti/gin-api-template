# gin-sampler

This is a sample gin api.

Here's a great [blog post](https://www.corletti.xyz/blog/go-gin-sampler) about it.

It persists data in a postgres store and follows 
a Router-API-Service-[DAO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_access_object)-Model design pattern. 

It probably works and can be used
as a boilerplate for more important projects that need a little kick in their 
step.

This project was built atop 
[go-build-template](https://github.com/thockin/go-build-template) by
[thockin](https://github.com/thockin); it is incredibly dope and helpful.
